progress:

- object checks and assigns vals

DONE
- select next var
- got solver finding chord factors of
- gets to target root

ISSUES/BUGS:
- running constraints over more than one var in the reg list means
  they don't actually run, see target-neighbour?


TODO:
- select domain value to try? (could just iterate through them)
- need to be able to shuffle domain values so we get different results
- make a program that takes a chord prog and gets four bars
  according to our rules
- add stochastic global constraints to sometimes allow big leaps
  or sometimes walk vs steps, or sometimes up, sometimes down


NEXT:
- need constraint for target neighbour

- got it going on to next bar, but it fails to solve
  when pre-assigned the starting note, figure out why
  - presumably that assignment is causing contraints to fail
  - yes, assigning the first note makes a failure
