progress:

- object checks and assigns vals

DONE
- select next var
- got solver finding chord factors of
- gets to target root

TODO:
- select domain value to try? (could just iterate through them)

- got constraint checking working nicely
- next: selecting next var and domain values,
- add post assignment check of global constraints with rollback
  - does not have rollback

- need to be able to shuffle domain values

NEXT:
- need constraint for target neighbour
