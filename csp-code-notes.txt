Notes on my csp code

csp-1
- job is to play a simple triad, choosing random realizations



LATER:
- assign constraints to their variables, for now can just run all of them naively

Representation notes
- we will need scales, which could be relative to the tonic key based on the chord function
- scale of IV M : p
  Maj#4: 1 M2 M3 A4 P5 M6 M7

functions we need
note-sym->note-num  C0 - 0, C5 - 60, etc

pre-assigned variables:
  tonic: C  
  tonality: Maj 
  root: II  
  quality: min7
to assign:
notes 0 to 4 (lets call them numbers 0 to 3
