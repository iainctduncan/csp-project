progress:

- object checks and assigns vals

DONE
- select next var
- got solver finding chord factors of
- gets to target root
- made constraint for target neighbour
  - only allows chromatic below or above

ISSUES/BUGS:
- running constraints over more than one var in the reg list means
  they don't actually run, see target-neighbour?


TODO:
- select domain value to try? (could just iterate through them)
- need to be able to shuffle domain values so we get different results
- make a program that takes a chord prog and gets four bars
  according to our rules
- add stochastic global constraints to sometimes allow big leaps
  or sometimes walk vs steps, or sometimes up, sometimes down
