CPS/search notes

Notes from Ghaderi paper, Lecture-04-Backtracking-Search.pdf

in backtracking search
- state is represented as a vector of possible feature values
- we have k-features (variables) 
- each feature takes a value from the domain of possible variables for the value
- the problem is to search for the set of values for the features such 
  the constraints are satisfied

Formally, CSP problem has
- a set of variables, V1...Vn
- for each variable, a domain of values: Dom[Vi]  
- a set of constraints, C1.. Cm

- a constraint, C, has a "scope", a set of variables it is over
- is a boolean function that maps assignments to these variables to #t/#f
- ex. C(V1=a, V2=b, V4=c) = True

Arity of constraints
- unary  C(X): X > 5
- binary C(X,Y): X + Y < 7

- how we pick the PickNextUnassignedVariable has major impact
  on performance

Solving:
- specialized version of depth first search
- search through space of partial assignments
- order in which we assign variables doesn't matter, eventually
  they must all be assigned
- if a constraint fails, we can reject all possible extensions of
  the current partial assignment

Constraint propagation
- looking ahead in search at as yet unassigned values
  to detect if any obvious failures have occured

Forward Checking
- extension of backtracking searcdh with modest amount of propogation/lookahead
- when a variable is instantiated, we check all constraints that
  have only one uninstantiated var remaining.
  - for the remaining var, we check all vlaues, pruning those that fail
    - we prune before recursing into the next depth, and we restore
      pruned vars if the current level fails, before we return
